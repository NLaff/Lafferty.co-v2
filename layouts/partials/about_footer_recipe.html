<p>👋 Hi, I'm Nick. Don't you hate it when recipe bloggers tell their whole life story before getting to the damn recipe?</p>

<p>I do too, so I wanted to do something about it. My recipes are different. You'll get the receipe first thing. You don't need to read my life story first, so I get right to the point.</p>
