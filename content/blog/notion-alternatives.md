Notion is my favorite [productivity tool of 2021](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/why-notion-is-the-best-productivity-app-of-2020/), but it's not for everyone. 

Notion's building block system for creating workspaces can take some time to master.

If you're still using Notion make sure to look at my [free notion template](/free-notion-templates/) library. 

But if you're seriously considering Notion alternatives then here's my top picks, based on my own research.

## ClickUp
![Clickup Homepage](/uploads/clickup_home.png)

I've [reviewed ClickUp](/reviews/clickup) before and it's by far the most compelling Notion alternative. 

But their pricing is almost double Notion's base pricing. ClickUp starts at $9/month and Notion starts at $5/month. 

ClickUp's unlimited plan includes unlimited everything:
* Unlimited Storage
* Unlimited Lists, Boards, and Calendar Views
* Unlimited Integrations
* Unlimited Dashboards
* and more

The difference between their Business and Unlimited plans is the Business plan includes single-signon(SSO), private and protected views, the ability to add extra guests to your workspace, and all their automation features.

## Alamanac

I learned about [Alamanac](https://click.nicklafferty.com/almanac) recently and it's a really powerful alternative to Notion, specifically for creating and maintaining workplace documentation. 

They're a 30 person company based out of San Francisco that has raised [$11 million](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/almanac-ce13) in seed funding. Compared to Notion's $2+ billion valuation as of April 2020, Almanac is much smaller in comparison.

But bigger is not always better. Take a look at Almanac's app.

Almanac is designed strictly to create and share workplace documentation. I've personally used Confluence to create documentation for my team at work and it's never been a great experience. 

Almanac feels like a hybrid of Confluence and Github. At the top of every Almanac doc is a way to upvote it (kind of like Github stars) and to make a copy (like forking a Github repo).

I plan on doing a more thorough review of Almanac soon and I'll make sure to update this space with a link.

## Hubstaff Tasks

Like Almanac, [Hubstaff Tasks](https://click.nicklafferty.com/hubstaff) is also a new product. Hubstaff is known for making time tracking software for field or remote teams. 

Hubstaff Tasks is designed for agile project management for sprint planning, kanban boards, to-do lists, and more. 

Hubstaff Tasks is more like Atlassian's JIRA product.

It also comes preloaded with 40+ customizable templates to automate the tedious project management work. 

Compared to Notion, Hubstaff Tasks is very focused on improving the workflow for software development teams. You could use Notion for agile project planning, but that's not Notion's core focus.

## Asana
![Asana Homepage](/uploads/asana_home.png)

Some people love Asana. The head of content marketing at my job is an Asana freak, and she manages the content calendar for three brands inside of Asana. Our visual designer also uses Asana to track new design requests.

Asana came to market before Notion, and Notion was clearly inspired by some of Asana's features. You can accomplish all of what Asana does with Notion instead.

Asana does one thing really well, but that's it. So if you're a Notion user looking for a project management tracker, then Asana might be a good choice.

Asana's plans start at $10.99/month, but their basic plan is enough to get started with for most people.

## Airtable
![Airtable Homepage](/uploads/airtable_home.png)

I cover [Notion vs Airtable](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/why-notion-is-the-best-productivity-app-of-2020/#notion-vs-airtable) extensively in another article, but there are some key differences I'll highlight here.

First is the brand aesthetic. Notion is black and white while Airtable embraces color everywhere. This follows through to their applications too: Notion's app is clean, almost sparse, minimal, and provides only what you need to get something done.

Airtable's app has colors everywhere and I personally find it a little too distracting. Airtable is like if the spreadsheet was designed in 2010, it's a connected databse with links, embeddable images, and multiple views of a single dataset. 

All of that data combined in a colorful presentation can be honestly overwhelming to someusers. I find Airtable's learning curve to be much higher than notion. 

Checkout my full review if you want more info, but Airtable is still a solid alternative to Notion.

## Conclusion

The best Notion alternative is [ClickUp](https://click.nicklafferty.com/clickup). They have the most similar featureset and almost anything you can do in Notion you can also do in ClickUp. 

If you're looking for an agile project management tool to replace JIRA, then I'd suggest [Hubstaff Tasks](https://click.nicklafferty.com/hubstaff).

And if you want a better alternative to Confluence for business documentation, I'd recommend [Almanac](https://click.nicklafferty.com/almanac).
