![Spicy Guacamole Recipe](/uploads/spicy_guacamole.jpg)

I've been making this guacamole recipe for years and it's always a hit with guests. My main substitutions compared to standard guacamole is green onions in place of white onion. My wife hates raw onion but green onion is small enough to sneak by.

My secret ingredient is **sriracha**. It adds some heat and extra flavor and makes this a super unique and personal guacamole recipe.

The key to a good guacamole starts with avocado. If your avocado is too firm or over ripe then your guac will suffer. When I want to make my best guacamole I try to pick the perfect avocados from the grocery store.

Yes, I'm that person squeezing avocados. Don't judge me.

The perfect avocado is just a little soft when you squeeze it. Too hard and it's not ready yet, too soft and it'll likely have brown spots.

If you can only find firm avocados then I recommend putting them in a brown bag on your counter top for a day or two. It's worth waiting to make really authentic guacamole.

I usually make my guacamole without jalapenos because I get heat from the Sriracha. If you're feeling extra spicy you can of course do both! I like the added crunch that raw jalapenos add to guacamole, and you can always remove the seeds to keep the heat down. 

Now, the cilantro. Some people hate cilantro because it tastes like soap to them. If that's you then just omit it, not a big deal. Cilantro adds some nice flavor depth to the guacamole but it's not a core ingredient. 

My wife didn't love cilantro until I kind of forced it upon her by making guac over and over again. Sorry not sorry. Now she's a fan.

Not everyone adds tomatoes to their guacamole. It can be a controversial addition but I personally like the flavor and color that tomatoes add to the dish. The red is very appealing surrounded by all the green from the avocados, onions, cilantro, and jalapenos. 

I prefer using tomatoes on the vine. I've found they have the best flavor of what I can get at the grocery store. Even better if you grow your own tomatoes, they'll have amazing flavor! 

I don't add a ton of salt to my guacamole because the chips are usually **very salty**. If you're not serving guac with chips then I recommend adding more salt to taste.

My favorite thing to put guacamole on is chicken fajitas. It makes for a quick, easy, and filling weeknight meal that you can have ready in less than an hour.
