## What is Project Management Software?
Project management software is used to schedule, plan, organize, and track the status of projects. 

A project can be anything from a home renovation, to a ProductHunt launch, to a wedding. 

Anything that involves breaking down a complex idea into smaller steps can be project planned.

Project management software helps organize all of the moving parts, due dates, and requirements for your project. 

It's software that can make your life easier, and best of all, many project management tools are free.

### Best Project Management Software for Gantt Charts
![ClickUp Project Management Software](/uploads/ClickUp.png)

Be sure to read my full [ClickUp review](https://nicklafferty.com/reviews/clickup/).

ClickUp is a workplace project management and productivity tool. It combines the best parts of Google Docs, Trello, and Asana into one easy to use, beautifully designed tool.

It has the best gantt chart implementation out of any tool I've seen.

And they have the funding to proove it. They raised a [$100M Series B](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/clickup-hits-1-billion-valuation-in-100m-series-b-raise/) in December 2020.

### Best Project Management Software For Small Business
![Wrike Project Management Software](/uploads/Wrike.png)

Be sure to read my [2021 Wrike review](/reviews/wrike/).

Wrike is the best project management tool for businesses.

That's because each plan comes with 5 user seats, so everyone on at your small business can have a seat. 

One of my freelance clients uses Wrike and they've been very happy with it. 

Wrike was just [acquired by Citrix](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/19/citrix-acquires-project-management-platform-wrike-for-2-25-billion/) for over $2 billion dollars.

That alone shows you how powerful of a project management tool Wrike is.

### Best Project Management Software for Teams
![Monday Project Management For Teams](/uploads/Monday_Header.png)

Monday.com is the best projet management tool for teams.

As of 2019 Monday was [valued at $1.9 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/monday-com-raises-150m-more-now-at-1-9b-valuation-for-workplace-collaboration-tools/), matching valuations from Notion and Wrike.

I've written a full [Monday.com review](/reviews/monday/) so be sure to check that out. 

Monday calls itself an operating system for work. It's entirely designed to be used at work, it has very little personal use cases.

And it's priced for work too. Monday's paid plans require purchasing 3 user seats, which increases the price to almost $30/month. 

At that price you'd expect a visually beautiful interface and more features than you know what to do with.

And that's exactly what you get with Monday.

Monday also offers a slew of ready-made templates to get you started quickly.

### Best Project Management Software for Freelancers
![Notion Project Management](/uploads/Notion_-_Best_Evernote_Alternative.png)

As a freelancer myself, I can confidently say Notion is the best project management tool for freelancers. 

Here's why: **it's free**.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. 

Scroll down to read my thoughts on Notion, or check out my comprehensive post on [why Notion is the best productivity tool](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/why-notion-is-the-best-productivity-app-of-2020/)

## My Favorite Tool
The best free project management software is **Notion**. 

Why? Because it's actually completely free.

Every single one of its features are available on the free plan. 

And it has paid off: Notion hit a massive [$2 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise) in 2020.

The bulk of their revenue comes from Enterprise contracts, followed by their Pro plan.

I am a paying Notion member because I use it for my consulting business.

I do [Google Ads Consulting](/consulting/) for software companies. I use Notion to present my data and track the progress of projects.

In other words, I practice what I preach in this article.

I started using Notion because I **hate** building Power Point presentations. 

I build enough of them in my day job at [Pathwire](https://www.pathwire.com), the last thing I want is to do them for my side business too.

So I use Notion instead. And it's much more enjoyable.

I send my clients a link to review, and after our engagement is over they'll always have access to that.

It won't get lost in their Google Drive with a million other docs. And even if they do lose it, it stays in my Notion account. 

I even used Notion to track the progress of my home purchase and renovation last year. 

I use Notion for everything:
* [Writing my daily journal](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/my-notion-journal-templates/)
* [Tracking my habits](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/how-i-ve-started-using-notion-to-track-my-life/)
* [Building a bullet journal](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/create-a-bullet-journal-in-notion-free-template/)
* [As a Kanban board](https://nicklafferty.com/blog/organize-your-writing-with-a-kanban-board/)

You may be thinking, man this guy promotes Notion a lot. He must be getting paid. 

**Nope**.

I am not a paid Notion affiliate. I'm just a big fan.

My Notion articles get almost 6,000 views from Google each month as of January 2021. 

I've written about Notion so much because I think it's a great product. 

I've also curated a list of the 32 [best Notion templates](/blog/free-notion-templates/).

## Wrapping Up

Notion is by far the best project management software on the market today.

It's also my favorite tool for tracking my habits, journaling, organizing my home renovation, and for managing my freelance business.

Monday.com, Wrike, and ClickUp all have their strengths too. Monday and Wrike are priced for business, and ClickUp is a promising tool that continues to improve at a mind-boggling pace.

You honestly can't go wrong with any of them.
